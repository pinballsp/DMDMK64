<b>Suggestions, to optimize coloring tasks with Magic Editor:</b>
<br><br>
1.- Use the Interactive Zoom with the Ctrl + Mouse Wheel.<br>
2.- Use Shift + Mouse Wheel for the thickness selection of the Brush to paint several pixels with several colors at once, it is a very powerful option and saves a lot of time.<br>
3.- Use the Right Mouse Button to toggle between paint and move the image.<br>
4.- Use Ctrl + Z to Undo any painting if it is not yet saved, so if the painting is wrong you can always undo it.<br>
5.- Generate groups of colors assigning a name to each group, so that when you need to use the same colors, simply select it in the drop-down menu of groups of colors. This will also save you a lot of time.<br>
6.- To automatically paint a frame, use the "Frame on Frame" button, with this option the program automatically paints the current frame based on the previous frame. It is not perfect, but it can save a lot of time, mainly if both images are similar.<br>
7.- You can generate Color Gradients automatically and save them by assigning a name, with the option View> Favorite colors. Also in this option you can create and save your favorite colors and Color groups.<br>
8.- Use the Smart Pencil with a Predefined Color Group, it is the MOST POWERFUL option of Magic Editor, together with the Frame over Frame, to paint quickly, in a simple and very comfortable way. It saves a lot of work time.<br>
